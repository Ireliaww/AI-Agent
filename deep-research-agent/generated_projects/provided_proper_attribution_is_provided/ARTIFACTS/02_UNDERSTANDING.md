# Deep Understanding & Key Insights

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

### Problem Statement
Based on the provided context, the main contributions of this paper are:

*   The introduction of the Transformer, which is presented as the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attenti

### Solution Approach
The proposed methodology is the **Transformer**, which is described as the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention. It replaces the recurrent layers commonly used in encoder-deco

### Why It Works
This approach is effective because it addresses the core limitations
of previous methods while introducing novel mechanisms that enable
better performance.
